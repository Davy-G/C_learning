# Description
This repository contains structured and curated code snippets and well documented C source codes written to explain basic c programming concepts. This is a memo of my journey learning and developing with the C programming language.

The choice of the Repo curated structure is highly opinated, i structured them this way because intuitively it felt proper to learn in this progression, with subsequent concepts building more on previous ones. if you do intend to use this repo and or any of it content as a reference material, it is highly likely that the structure would not matter much to you,as you could just move into folders containing the concept you wish to look at. but for people looking to use it as learning material, following the assumed progression would better aid your learning process and progress. 

## Usage
- Any and all code improvements are whole-heartedly accepted
- The codes provided in this repo are under no restriction in terms of usage
- Use the codes here wisely, as there were written by a budding c programmer
- Any Attribution to the repo is also welcomed

## NOTE:
Since most of the codes here were written as a result of learning and praticing with concepts and ideas in the c programming language ecosystem, some code are not so-efficient and may not be an appropriate option for practical applications and solutions.

Constructive approach are welcomed to request edition and suggest changes to the code found in this repo.
